# deque_deck
 
This crate provides a simple interface for creating and manipulating a fully generic deck of cards.
 
## Usage
 
Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
 
```toml
[dependencies]
deque_deck = "0.1.0"
```
 
Standard manipulations of a deque data structure are available but for convenience have been renamed to reflect the language used for decks of cards. So "draw" is used in place of "pop" and "cut" is used in place of "left_rotate" and so on. 
 
Various shuffling algorithms are supported. 
 
### Fisher-Yates
The default shuffling method uses the Fisher-Yates algorithm which provides maximal randomness but does not reflect physical shuffling. Each card in the original deck is equally likely to have any position in the shuffled deck. Any case in which high quality randomness is needed should use this method.
 
```rust
let mut deck = Deck::from([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]);
deck.shuffle();
// Deck{ [1, 9, 7, 6, 2, 8, 4, 5, 0, 3] }
```
 
### Riffle (Gibert-Shannon-Reeds)
The riffle method uses the Gibert-Shannon-Reeds algorithm to pick a point near the middle of the deck (using a binomial distribution), then split the deck and riffle the two halves together.
 
 ```rust
let mut deck = Deck::from([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]);
deck.riffle();
// Deck{ [5, 6, 0, 7, 1, 8, 2, 3, 4, 9] }
```
 
### Overhand  (Pemantle)
The overhand method uses Pemantleâ€™s algorithm to take packets of cards from the top and place them successively on the bottom.
 
 ```rust
let mut deck = Deck::from([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]);
deck.overhand();
// Deck{ [9, 7, 8, 6, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, ] }
```

### Other Shuffles
The pile shuffle and Gilbreath shuffle are available to simulate those less common methods. The inverse riffle shuffle and the original Premantle shuffle are available for statistical puroposes but do not represent any real-world shuffling technique. The faro is also provided as, althrough it is not a true shuffle, it is closely related to the riffle shuffle.
